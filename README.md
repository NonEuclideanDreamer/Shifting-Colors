# Shifting-Colors
Creates Images of Selfsimilar Tilings with shifting colors that can be put together to a video.
This is accomplished by continuously changing the color instruction for the iteration of the Tiling.

Since refactoring code so that it is readable is hard, I instead refactored it so that the settings can be changed from a config file.
To play with the program follow these steps:
-Save config.txt and the jar-file in the same folder.
-Edit the config-file to your liking. (Keep the formating as is, ti is not fool-proof)
-Safe your changes.
-Start the jar-file. (If you start it from the command line, you see the color configurations it's moving through)
-Close the window to terminate the program

To work on the code, make a java project containing all the classes. (I use eclipse) I hope to make it more readable at some point.
